# **About Me**

Hi! I am a web developer and programmer. I have graduated as Master of Computer Science at Poznan University of Technology. I like solving puzzles and taking on challenging tasks. In my spare time I solve puzzles and who am I kidding? Spare time is for sleeping. 

Please contact only with interesting projects and adequate salary.
