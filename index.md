# About me

Hi, I am a .NET developer and Docker DevOps specialist with experience in empowering businesses by utilizing cloud-based tools to efficiently scale their solutions and expand their client base. My expertise lies in developing robust, scalable applications and automating deployment pipelines to optimize performance and operational workflows.

I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the Poznań University of Technology, where I gained a deep understanding of software engineering principles and best practices. I enjoy solving complex puzzles and taking on challenging tasks that push the boundaries of my skills and knowledge.

In my work, I emphasize quality through various testing methods and CI pipelines for reliability and fast iterations. Additionally, I leverage AWS and Azure to support cloud-based solutions and deployment processes in development and ensuring continuous operation through scalable architecture.

If you are interested in discussing any aspect of my experience or expertise, I would be delighted to connect. Feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn for any collaboration opportunities.
