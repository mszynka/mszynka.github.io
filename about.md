I am a web developer and programmer.

I've just graduated as Bachelor of Computer Science at Poznan University of Technology. I work as Full Stack .NET Developer at Mediporta.pl. I'm looking forward to any oportunity to learn web development and software programming from experts.

Among many tasks I'm also a musician. (Although I don't have any musical degree)
