Hi! I'm Mateusz and I'm a web developer and programmer. 

I've just graduated as Bachelor of Computer Science at Poznan University of Technology and I work as Full Stack .NET Developer at Mediporta.pl.

I'm looking forward to any oportunity to learn web development and software programming from experts.

Among many tasks I'm also a musician. (Although I don't have any musical degree)

Thousand ideas but not enough time for all of them.
