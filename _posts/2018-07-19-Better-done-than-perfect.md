Have you ever wondered how many things you may be able to accomplish when you just leave the rat race to create perfect and most exquisite solution to any given problem and stick with a 'doer' approach?

After couple of years I have spend on development and while working with various people, companies and management styles all I am sure about is that 'It all depends...'. One is to seek maintainable solutions but other is to build your own Cathedral[^1] just for the sake of building one. Also you can never choose one approach over the other. Instead you should consider calculating what ratio between them is optimal and what may not be. There are many factors which can change your decision on how to split the ratio between both approaches but only three or four are reusable and applicable in most of encountered situations.

### 1. Available time frame

In modern world the idea of constant and iterable changes is more common and fully present in many aspects of life regardless of the matter. With that in mind we should always consider the time frame as one of the main factors in solution design because let's face it: A late ambulance is meaningless when the patient is terminal and untreatable.

### 2. Is it worth it?



### 3. Solution longevity



### 4. The eternal dilemma (choose one)
