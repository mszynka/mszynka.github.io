First of all my personal life got a little more complicated than I wanted to accept. 
I've got a lot more new responsibilities and I do a lot more of freelance work outside. 
I'm playing organ on a regular basis which has taken my love for carpentry a step back. 
I also do a lot more construction now. 

All I'm saying is that we should not focus on a one thing only since life is a lot more complicated. 
I'm personally more of a DaVinci type meaning that I tend to do a lot of things at once. 
It's either the ADHD or just my mentality that I like to have things done rather than perfect. 

There are things that we should not treat with this attitude in any case. 
Safety being the main aspect. But after all we are humans. 
And what has always pushed us forward was a little bit of brawery and a lot of curiosity to push the human race forward.

Back to the topic then I still write some new article but for PL language only on [solid.jobs/blog](https://solid.jobs/blog) 
and I will not add anything new for now here. The blog is not dead.

Good luck.
Stay alive!
