## Existing modules

### Projects

More fancy way of project management with our project module. It's capable of soring tasks and meetings, user binding, time management and more.

### Tasks

Every major project has to be parted to particular tasks. By easing job management and user binding you can always track progress of your projects.

### Meeting

Handling appointments when in developer mood keeps getting harder? Try our meeting module. It's awesome! :wink:

### Worklog

Ever suspicious how your project progress is doing? Now you can track every move and task with worklog module.
